#  Scripting & Automation
Built a Tcl-based automation framework for Xilinx Vivado that synthesizes multiple Verilog designs in batch mode,
extracts area, power, and delay reports, and consolidates results into a CSV file. Implemented error detection to skip
non-synthesizable designs and continue the flow, improving productivity and verification efficiency.
